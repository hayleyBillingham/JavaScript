a while statement starts with the keyword while
While uses a boolean expression that we call a conditional test, or contidional
If the conditional is trure, everything is the code bloxk is executed
The code block is everything between the curly braces
if the contional is true then after we execute the code block we loop back around and do it all again if the conditional is false we stop looping
