	<h1>Constants</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The value of a variable can change throughout the program</li>
		<li>Sometimes we would want to use a symbol that will not change and that is called a constant</li>
		<li>Constants must be initialised with a value</li> 
		<li>If a value is assigned later on in the program to the constant variable then an error will occur</li>
	</ul>
