	<h1>Object Assign and Immutability</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Sometimes in JavaScript you would want to create a new object from an existing one of merge two object properties together	</li>
		<li>
		The object.assign() method allows you to assign properties from one object to another object
		<li>Object assign allows you to merge objects together</li>
		<li>A function should never really mutate the objects that are passed into it</li>
		<li>To avoid functions mutating object you can create a new object literal</li>
	</li>
</ul>
