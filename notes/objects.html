	<h1>Objects</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Objects are the key to managing complex code</li>
		<li>Objects are basically complex variable types</li>
		<li>Objects let you group information together into a single variable</li>
		<li>Objects help the understanding of browser's document model</li>
		<li>Objects not only encapsulate information but functionality to that object using methods</li>
		<li>Objects allow you to organise your data</li>
		<li>Objects are just a collection of properties</li>
		<li>To create an object with an object literally you simply define the properties and their values within curly braces</li>
		<li>
			In real life car is an object and a car has properties
			<ul>
				<li>A car has properties like colour and weight</li>
				<li>A car has a make</li>
				<li>A car has a model</li>
				<li>A car has a year that is was manufactured</li>
				<li>Cars have a milage number</li>
				<li>Cars have a maximum number of passagers</li>
				<li>Cars dont just have properites they  have behaviours too<ul>
				<li>A car has methods like start and stop</li>
				<li>All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car</li>
				<li>All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times</li></ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Objects are variable too, but objects can contain many values
				<ul>
					<li>example: var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon)</li>
			<li>JavaScript objects are containers for named values</li>
		</ul></li></ul>
			<h2>Object Properties</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The name:value pairs are called properties</li>
				<li>To assign properties to an object
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4 class="example-text">access an array item</h4>
						<div class="example">
							<code>var chevy = {make: "Chevy", model:"Bel Air", year: 1957, color: "red", passengers: 2, convertible: false, milage: 1021};</code>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>An object can be reused</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Object methods</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Methods are actions that can be performed on objects</li>
				<li>Methods are stored in properties as function definitions</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Object Definition</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Accessing Object Properties</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>You can access object properties in two ways
					<ul><li>
						objectName.PropertyName
					</li>
					<li>
						objectName["propertyName"]
					</li></ul></li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Accessing Object Methods</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>You can access object methods with the following syntax
						<ul><li>
							objectName.methodName()
						</li></ul>

					</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
