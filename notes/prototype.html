	<ul><li>Objects are the foundations to almost every aspect of the JavaScript programming language</li>
		<li>Objects are key/value pairs</li>
		<li>The most common way to create an object is with curly braces {}</li>
		<li>The dot notation is used to add properties and methods to the object</li>
		<li>If we need to create more than one object then the logic needs to be encapsulated inside of a function.  We can invoke whenever we need that object
