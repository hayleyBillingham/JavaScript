<ul><li>
		You can dcalre varibales with let and var keyword
</li>
	<li>Let keyword has to be run in sequential order</li>
	<li>var keyword does not have to be written in sequential order</li>;
	<li>The let keyword only exists in the code block and will run an error if referenced from outside that code block</li>
	<li>The var keyword scope can be referenced outside the code block without an error</li>
	<li>let had block scoping but let does not</li>
	<li>Programmers prefer let over var as we want an error to be thrown rather than undefined</li>
	<li>programmers want the console to complain if there is a problem with the code</li>
