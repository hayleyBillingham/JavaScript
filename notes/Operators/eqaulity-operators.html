	<h1>Equality Operators</h1>
	<ul><li>Equality operators lets us compare if two values are equal</li>
		<li>Inequality operators lets us know if two values are not equal</li>
		<li>If a condition is eqaual then a code block will execute</li>
		<li>if the condition is == then it is the value they look for being equal</li>
		<li>if the condition is === then its the value and the type of variable is compared - this is strict equlaity operator</li>
		<li>the strict eqaulity operator is best practice</li>
		<li>!= is not equal to  - will do type conversion</li>
		<li> !== is double not equal to this does not do any type conversion</li>
		<li>normally these statements appear in if statements, while loops or other places where you expect conditionals</li>
