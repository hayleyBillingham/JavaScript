	<h1>Prototypes overview</h1>
	<ul><li>
			A prototype is a object that exists on every function in javaScript	
	</li>
	<li>Objects do have a prototype but they do not have a prototype property</li>
	<li>A function's prototype is the object instance that will become the prototype for all objects created using this function as a constructor</li>
	<li>A Object's prototype is the object instance from which the object is inherited</li>
	<li>A function and a object prototype is actually an instance of an object in memory</li>
	<li>When a function has a created a new prototype, object is created in memmory and attached to the function behind the scenes</li>
	<li>If that function is then used as a constructor function with the new key word, the new object that has been created has a proto property that is pointing to the same object in memory that is the functions prototype</li>
