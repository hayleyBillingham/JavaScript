    <h1>Callbacks</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
      </li>
      <li>This technique allows a function to call another function</li>
      <li>a callback function can run after another function has finished</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Function Sequence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        JavaScript functions are executed in the sequence they are called not in
        the sequence they are defined
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sequence Control</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sometimes you would like to have better control over when to execute a
        function
      </li>
      <li>
        Suppose you want to do a calculation, and then display the result. You
        could call a calculator function (myCalculator), save the result, and
        then call another function (myDisplayer) to display the result
      </li>
      <li>
        Or you could call a calculator function (myCalculator), and let the
        calculator function call the display function (myDisplayer)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>JavaScript Callbacks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a callback you could call the calculator function (myCalculator)
        with a callback, and let the calculator function run the callback after
        the calculation is finished:
      </li>
      <li>When you pass a function as an argumnet, remember not to use parenthesis.</li>
      <li>Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait for another function (like waiting for a file to load(</li>
